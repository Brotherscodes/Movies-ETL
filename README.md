# Movies-Extract_Transform_Load

## Project Overview:

An Extract-Transform-Load pipeline was created to extract the three movie related databases provided and then loaded into a single database. Data can come from many sources, but most needs to be cleaned and structured before any noteworthy analysis can be performed. Using Python and Pandas I explored the data and performed any neccessary data transformation to maintain its integrity and consistency. Lastly, the clean final data was loaded into a postgreSQL database.
